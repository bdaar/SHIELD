+ Due to the update and redesign of the program, we are suspended; \n The service of the previous versions has been reduced and will soon stop working, and from this date onwards it will be considered a demo or release version...

```qsharp
namespace Quantum.Sample {
    operation HelloQ() : Unit {
        Message("ðŸ‘‹ Hello from the quantum world!");
    }
}
```

+ Thank's for your patience ( [bÌ´dÌ´aar](https://github.com/bdaar) 2024 JAN).
